Cybersecurity is the practice of protecting computer systems, networks, and data from theft, damage, or unauthorized access. With the rise of digital technologies, the importance of cybersecurity has skyrocketed, as organizations face increasing threats from cybercriminals and malicious actors. Effective cybersecurity measures encompass a range of strategies, including encryption, firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and user education. As cyber threats evolve, so too must security protocols, emphasizing the need for continuous monitoring and updating of defenses to safeguard sensitive information and maintain trust in digital platforms.
